## Math weights vs Writing weights

### Enrollement
For Math and Writing the weighting for enrollment seems almost perfectly the same.

This shows that having a large school doesnt benefit math or writing more

### Latitude 

For Math and Writing the weighting for latitude is the biggest difference in weights in the entire set, affecting math much more than writing

For schools more North of the globe (As latitude increases), it shows that the math scores are massivly reduced while writing scores are not impacted as much

One possible factor that this could show is the disparity in gender as you travel further north

Boys tend to preform better in math and there are more buys than girls aged 0-14 in ontario yet a very equal amount in nothern territories such as nunavut

Another factor could be the disparity in income for northern schools affects math more than writing

### Longitude 

For Math and Writing the weighting for longitude is a moderate difference 

As you go east(As longitude increases) the marks for writing go down while the math mark goes up

### Percentage of Students Whose First Language Is Not English

For Math and Writing the weighting for this is a very small difference 

As the percentage in this stat increases, both math and writing go up slightly 

This is shokcing to me as i believed that kids who don't have englsh as thier first langauge would struggle more in writing as I did, but the stat actually increases both math and writing marks a little bit

### PercentageofStudentsWhoseFirstLanguageIsNotFrench

For Math and Writing the weighting for longitude is a moderate difference 

As the percentage in this stat increases the marks for math decrease yet the marks for writing increase 

This could show how people who come from french speaking countries have zero trouble learning a worse language, yet struggle in math

A possibility is that students coming from underdeveloped french speaking countries like Madagascar, Rwanda, Romania, Senegal and France have a harder time learning math than writing.

# Impoving the program

An R value of just over 0.5 for math and 0.48 for writing is not amazing

We could impliment more segments to the code that could improve efficiency or depth 

For efficiency we could make the program faster 

every time we run the program the weights are exaclty the same which shows the program doesn't iterate internally

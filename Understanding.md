### Enrollement
For Math and Writing the weighting for enrollment seems almost perfectly the same.

This shows that having a large school doesnt benefit math or writing more

### Latitude 

For Math and Writing the weighting for latitude is the biggest difference in weights in the entire set, affecting math much more than writing

For schools more North of the globe (As latitude increases), it shows that the math scores are massivly reduced 

One possible factor that this could show is the disparity in gender in northern schools such as in nunavut
